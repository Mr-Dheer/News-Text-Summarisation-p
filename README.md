# Introduction 
n today’s rapidly evolving and interconnected world, it
is impossible to overstate the importance of news. It plays
a crucial function as a catalyst for the development of a
society that makes informed decisions. The news is an essential component of democracies because it enables citizens to
participate actively in civic affairs. However, the vast quantity
of information and the overwhelming nature of news articles
can be daunting, posing a challenge for those who want to
keep themselves updated. The application of Natural Language
Processing’s text summarization [1] models to news articles
arises as a potential solution. This method involves condensing
extensive news articles into concise formats, thereby presenting the main points in an effective manner. By summarising
news articles, individuals are able to remain updated of global
events, saving them time and encouraging diverse news consumption.
