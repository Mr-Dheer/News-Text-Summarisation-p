# 🌐 News-Text-Summarisation 📰

In today’s rapidly evolving and interconnected world, it
is impossible to overstate the importance of news. It plays
a crucial function as a catalyst for the development of a
society that makes informed decisions. The news is an essential component of democracies because it enables citizens to
participate actively in civic affairs. However, the vast quantity
of information and the overwhelming nature of news articles
can be daunting, posing a challenge for those who want to
keep themselves updated. The application of Natural Language
Processing’s text summarization [1] models to news articles
arises as a potential solution. This method involves condensing
extensive news articles into concise formats, thereby presenting the main points in an effective manner. By summarising
news articles, individuals are able to remain updated of global
events, saving them time and encouraging diverse news consumption

## Overview

This project harnesses Natural Language Processing techniques for extractive text summarization. It seamlessly retrieves the latest news using the News API and generates concise summaries of articles. As most APIs provide headlines or links to articles rather than complete content, this project tackles the need for comprehensive articles. Leveraging web scraping with BeautifulSoup on the article links from the News API, the model summarizes the content, delivering concise, consumable articles.

## Functionality 🛠️

- **News Retrieval:** Utilizes News API to collect the latest news articles.
- **Web Scraping:** Retrieves full articles by scraping content from the provided article links.
- **Text Summarization:** Implements a graph-based model for extractive text summarization using TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and Google’s PageRank algorithm.
- **Website Integration:** Offers a user-friendly interface to search and access summarized news articles.

## Model Working 🧠

The graph-based model for extractive text summarization operates through several steps:

1. **Tokenization and Vectorization:** Text is tokenized into sentences and transformed into numerical representations using TF-IDF.
2. **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates sentence similarity using cosine relationship, generating a similarity matrix.
3. **Graph Construction:** Constructs a graph with sentences as nodes and edge weights reflecting sentence similarity.
4. **PageRank Algorithm:** Applies Google’s PageRank algorithm to score sentence importance within the context of the text.
5. **Summary Generation:** Ranks sentences based on PageRank scores, composing the extractive summary from the top-ranked sentences, effectively capturing the essential content of the original text.

The graph-based approach also involves creating a visual representation of the sentence similarity graph. Below is an illustration of the graph generated during the summarization process:
